I want to build a web app to track my running progress through London’s parks and green spaces.

Core goal

My goal is to run through as many London parks and green spaces as possible over the course of a year. The app should visually track progress and completion.

Key features

Interactive Map

Map of London (Leaflet or Mapbox preferred).

Each park is shown as a polygon outline (park boundary), not a point.

Parks start green and turn gold when completed.

Clicking a park opens an info popup.

A park is not automatically marked complete on click — the user must explicitly click a “Mark as complete” button in the popup.

Run Tracking (Future Integration)

Design with future Strava + Komoot integration in mind.

When a run route intersects a park polygon, that park should be automatically marked complete.

Assume routes are polylines and parks are polygons; completion is based on spatial intersection.

OAuth + API integration will be required later, but architecture should allow for this.

Progress Tracker

Prominently display completion stats, e.g.:

“50 / 3000 parks completed”

Percentage completed

Progress should dynamically update based on active filters (see below).

Filters / Toggles (Left Sidebar)
Filters affect both map display and progress stats.

Borough (multi-select dropdown)

Type of site (multi-select dropdown, e.g. park, garden, churchyard, open space)

Open to public (multi-select dropdown; values are strings, not booleans, e.g. “Yes”, “No”, “Occasionally”)

Data Model
Each park record should include:

id

name

borough

site_type (string, not enum)

open_to_public (string; preserve original values)

polygon coordinates (GeoJSON-style)

completed (boolean)

completed_date (optional)

Admin / Private Data Page

A private admin page for the owner only.

Displays all imported park data in a spreadsheet/table view.

Searchable and sortable.

Acts as the single source of truth for the main Park Tracker page.

Optional CSV import/export support.

Importing Park Data

Parks can be imported in bulk from a file (CSV/JSON).

Import should:

Create new parks if they don’t exist.

Prevent duplicates (same name + borough).

Preserve all source data fields exactly (especially site_type and open_to_public).

Parks may initially be imported with placeholder coordinates, then updated later with real polygon data.

UI / Design

Clean, modern, athletic feel.

Colors:

Green = not completed

Gold = completed

Left sidebar:

Progress stats at top

Filter dropdowns below

Main area:

Interactive map

Optional list/table view of parks

Tech expectations

Modern React stack (React + Vite or Next.js).

Map library: Leaflet or Mapbox.

Geospatial operations for route–polygon intersection.

Clean separation between data layer, map rendering, and UI state.

Designed to scale to ~3,000 parks without performance issues.

Non-goals (for now)

No social features.

No multi-user support required initially (single-user app).

Authentication can be minimal or mocked.
